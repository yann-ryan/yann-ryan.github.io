SP_29/155_f.115,Capt. John Tippetts,Samuel Pepys,1666-05-10,Portsmouth,London,"<p>John Tippelts to Sam. Pepys. Many ships having been sheathed in other places, can give no account of the time when it was done. The Mary and Newcastle have been sheathed a long time. With a list of 24 ships, and note how long some have had their sheathing.</p>"
SP_29/158_f.87,Henry Bennet Earl of Arlington,Sir Joseph Williamson,1666-06-06,Saxham,Whitehall,"<p>[Lord Arlington] to Williamson. Sends a relation for the King, thinking he may not have had so particular a one. Wants an express to-morrow on his way. Asks if His Majesty is going down to the coast. Sir Thos. Clifford's letter should be called for when the King has done with it, that it be not lost. With the postal envelope, ordering the letter to be immediately dispatched, &amp;c.</p>"
SP_29/160_f.47,Sir Thomas Allin,Samuel Pepys,1666-06-28,"Royal James, Buoy of the Nore",London,"<p>Sir Thos. Allin to Sam. Pepys. Desires immediate reimbursement, out of the contingent moneys, of the money expended in impressing seamen.</p>"
SP_29/165_f.9,Sir Thomas Allin,Sir Joseph Williamson,1666-07-27,Royal James,Whitehall,"<p>Sir Thos. Allin to Williamson. The engagement began the 25th, 9 a.m. His squadron led the van and began the dispute with the enemy's van, the generals with their main, and the Blue with the rear. After five hours' fighting, about 3 p.m., the Dutch began to run. Took two ships in the chase, one commanded by the Vice-admiral of Zealand, but he escaped into another ship. After taking out the prisoners, fired the ships, not having men to man them. The generals sunk two ships. Was in chase all night, and at 4 a.m., bearing up to De Ruyter, was wounded by splinters in the arm, and his face torn almost from ear to chin. Left the Dutch going into Flushing; they must lose many men, most of their ships being disabled. The Blue parted from them with 35 of the enemy. Failed to get between these 35 sail, and knows not what the Blue admiral has done.</p>"
SP_29/167_f.36,James Halsall,G. Porter,1666-08-10,London,Whitehall,"<p>Jas. Halsall to George Porter, stone gallery, Whitehall. Mrs. Carter, the poor woman they met yesterday, formerly lived with Mrs. Abbott, and preserved in her house Tom Blague, Robin Killigrew, Sir Rob. Shirley, Mr. O'Neale, Nic. Armorer, Lord Rochester, himself, and many others of the King's servants; she was their confidant and very faithful, and is now ready to starve; it would be a charity to get her into a hospital, or find her some means to live.</p>"
SP_29/167_f.209,Aphara Behn,James Halsall,1666-08-16,Antwerp,London,"<p>[Aphara Behn to Mr. Halsall]. Has had an interview with Celadon [Wm. Scott], taking a coach and going a day's journey with him for an opportunity of speaking to him; though at first shy, he became by arguments extremely willing to undertake the service, but said she must go to Holland, as [BampfieldJ hardly suffers him out of his sight, especially to go to Flanders, being the most jealous creature alive of the English officers about him. Celadon intends to resign his place in the troops, and accept some office less troublesome, and where he can do more effectually what she desires. He thought some time ago, of corresponding with Lord Arlington, but was prevented. [Bampfield] hides nothing from him, but watches all his actions so closely that he fears difficulty in sending what he writes. All the English are infinitely dissatisfied with [Bampfield], and most of them resolve to quit his troop and address themselves to the [States], from whom they expect more civility than from him who has drawn them in, and tries to keep them from such applications. Thinks she must venture to the Hague rather than miss what he promises, but Sir Ant. Desmarces, with whom she sailed, and to whom she told her business, advises her not to go to Holland. The man in Ludgate is a base rogue; he left, promising to set up a correspondence in all English seaports, and to let the Hollanders know when any merchant ships went out. Has spent the 40<i>l.</i> she brought with her, and wants money. Sends a cypher in single characters, which is easier than the double one she was to employ.</p>"
SP_29/169_f.47,Aphara Behn,James Halsall,1666-08-27,Antwerp,London,"<p>Aphara Behn to Mr. Halsall. Has been unable to do anything yet, Mr. Nipho and Sir Anthony [Des Marces] assist her, but can witness that it is a hard matter; dares not for her life go to Holland. On the burning of these ships, they have sent for their troops back from Germany. Trump and his brother are dismissed from office, and their sister degraded; there is great desolation at Amsterdam, and one of the states is turned out of the council. Hopes soon to settle a way of correspondence with the rogue, who expresses great desire to serve. Complains of the expensiveness of the place, and begs for money; has been forced to pawn a ring to pay her messengers. With a key to the cypher used subsequently in the correspondence.</p>"
SP_29/169_f.49,William Scott,Aphra Behn,1666-08-28,Rotterdam,Antwerp,"<p>[Wm. Scott to Aphara Behn]. Dares say little lest his letter should miscarry, there being a general expectation of something breaking out; wishes to meet her, but it must not be at the Hague. Wants her cypher, if it could be sent by a safe hand.</p>"
SP_29/169_f.155,Aphra Behn,James Halsall,1666-08-31,Antwerp,London,"<p>Aphara [Behn] to Major Halsall. Has at length met with Mr. Scott, who leaves nothing unsaid to beget confidence, seems earnest in his wish to serve, and wants not wit nor address, but only money; the States not having paid them, he is in debt at Amsterdam, and cannot leave; he thinks it best to quit his military employment, as it would keep him too far from the places where his services are needed; he would go at once, but cannot do it without a speedy supply. Celadon [Scott] will do nothing further without full authority, but he should be encouraged, for he can and will do service, and first he must be assured of his pardon. Sands Temple's treachery should not be suddenly discovered, or it may undo all; he is a damnable rogue, and should be kept in prison, for if he be let out, he will get into Holland, discover who have informed of him, and ruin all</p>"
SP_29/169_f.157,Aphra Behn,Thomas Killigrew,1666-08-31,Antwerp,London,"<p>A. Behn to Thos. Killigrew. Is obliged to trouble him, as she can get no reply from Mr. Halsall. Celadon [Scott] is most ready to serve His Majesty, but fears being ill dealt with, as all the King's friends there complain of the slenderness of their rewards; yet he tells her everything on her bare word, as confidently as if he had the King's great seal. He must have money, for though the States profess great esteem for the English troops, they have not paid them. Bampfield himself is out of money; dares not go to Holland for fear of Bampfield's jealousy, so gave [Scott] money to come twice to her, which cost 10<i>l.</i> a time, and all their letters have to be sent by special messengers. Complains of great expenses; brought only 40<i>l.</i> with her, and has to spend 10 guilders a day. Corney, a man in Antwerp, threatens to kill Celadon [Scott] if he comes again, and Bampfield, if he knew of his coming, would accuse him of treachery; therefore [Scott] is afraid to write in his own hand. Corney talks of being employed, and boasts as though he were the King's right hand, but he talks such rhodomontades as to </p><br><p><cpg id=""cmpg0723"" first=""yes"">83</cpg><pg id=""cmpg0723"" seq=""0114"" first=""yes"">83</pg>be dangerous to trust; entreats for money; owes 25<i>l.</i> or 30<i>l.</i>; will want more than 50<i>l.</i> to pay her debts and go to Holland, Begs to have [Scott's] pardon, and some assurance as to what he may expect.</p>"
SP_29/170_f.88,Aphra Behn,Thomas Killigrew,1666-09-04,Antwerp,London,"<p>[Aphara Behn] to Thos. Killigrew. Begs not to be made incapable of serving for want of money, having pawned her very rings to get the man [Scott] there; the place is so dear that she has been unable to buy so much as a shoe to travel in. Wants 100<i>l.</i> to pay her debts and go to the Hague. [Scott] is so cautious that he makes all pass through her hands, and expects her and money daily. Wants a copy of Sands Temple's letter to Bampfield; the letters of Bampfield should be taken. Begs for the money to be sent to Mr. Piers, in whom she can confide.</p>"
SP_29/171_f.159,Aphra Behn,Unknown,1666-09-14,Antwerp,London,"<p>[Aphara Behn to Mr. Halsall]. Her letters from Holland say that the French fleet cannot be got ready to join the Holland fleet, and that a speedy battle may prevent the joining. There are disorders in the States, and another is displaced from the Council for visiting Buat in prison. It is said that if our fleet win, the Prince [of Orange], who is at Cleves, will return with an army, and the army in Holland is generally for him. Also, that Benjamin Turley is the quaker in whom the fanatics so confide, but his name is not to be mentioned.</p>"
SP_29/172_f.15,Aphra Behn,Thomas Killigrew,1666-09-17,Antwerp,London,"<p>A. Behn' to [Thos. Killigrew]. Complains much of Mr. Halsall's silence, which puts a sensible delay to all service. [Scott] is very cautious, yet wants only a little encouragement, beyond her bare word, to do all that is desired of him, but three posts having passed and no reply, he begins to think himself neglected. Defends herself for having sent for money by a servant, who is neither a cheat nor a traitor, though a mean fellow. Her mother was not fit to come for it, and Sir Thomas is seldom in town. Will mind what she is about diligently, how great a child soever she may be in other matters. Is in a private lodging, but only wants money to remove to. a cheaper place where Scott can come. All the rogues from Holland flock thither, and talk such treason about the King as would make one mad. Urges for money, and begs his good opinion and that of His Majesty Will never betray him nor herself through her folly. Has sent some papers in Mr. Williamson's packet.</p>"
SP_29/172_f.16,Wm Scott,Aphara Behn,1666-09-17,Antwerp,London,"<p><i>Wm. Scott to Aphara Behn. Will use his cypher on arrival at the Hague, where Bampfield will watch him. There will he intestine trouble if the Dutch fleet lose the day; they are gone so far westward, with</i> 82 <i>ships of war and</i> 24 <i>fire-ships, that in case of loss, they could only retreat to the French ports. In that case the people will declare their discontent, and bear the war no longer. Buat still remains in prison; Mynheer Pau's son, who visited him, there, is removed from the council. A report is spread, in order to frighten others, that he has confessed much. Has been with Benj. Turley, the quaker, and found Phelps and Major Radwell with him; judges that something is brewing. Hill has been imprisoned, but is released on security not to return to Holland without leave. Bampfield said he had engaged Hill eight or nine months ago to go to England and manage a correspondence with the Presbyterians, and Hill reported to Bampfield a meeting which the writer was to hold with others of the King's friends at Leyden. Hill wanted to establish himself as Greek professor at Leyden, or as a minister after Mr. Maiden, whose daughter he wishes to marry, and he has been to England to dispose of all his property there, &amp;c. He also engaged with the fiscal of admiralty in Zealand to keep up a correspondence at Ostend and in England, to discover what merchant ships could be made prizes of, and to prepare those in England for a correspondence with the Hollanders, when opportunity offers. Thinks the fanatics at the Hague need not be feared, if due caution be observed. A woman's letter has been intercepted at the Hague. Hopes it is not hers. With note</i> [<i>by Aphara Behn</i>], <i>certifying this to be a true copy of Mr. Scott's letter, and adding that the intercepted letter named</i></p><br><p>

  <pg id=""cmpg1148"" seq=""0167"" first=""yes"">136</pg>
  <i>was not hers, but that Mr. Corney's tongue should he clipped, as not knowing her business, he does great hurt.</i>
</p>"
SP_29/172_f.90,Sir Thomas Allin,Sir Joseph Williamson,1666-09-20,Royal James,London,"<p>Sir Thos. Allin to Williamson. On the 18th the Prince, fearing the extremity of the weather, slipped cable and made for the Downs, with mostof the fleet; was left with 20 frigates between Fairleigh and Dungeness, four miles from land, when, at 3 p.m., six French ships were seen, the first of which, the Ruby, a ship of 1,000 tons, 412 men and 54 guns, came up, mistaking him for the French general, but was not dismayed and returned his fire; fetched her up again 10 p.m., poured in a broadside, and received one which cost 40 men, but falling in with two other frigates, the French ship yielded. The fleet will water and refit at St. Helen's Road. The French general, on reaching Dieppe, received orders to sail for Brest.</p>"
SP_29/172_f.104,Ap Behn,James Halsall,1666-09-21,Antwerp,London,"<p>A. B. [Apbara Behn] to Mr. Halsall. Celadon [Scott] is everjoyed with the promise of his pardon, and will serve more fully when it has arrived, for till then he fears lest he may ruin himself with both sides. He justifies himself as to his conduct to Oudart and Corney, and also as to Mr. Hill, saying that he could only save himself by being the first to carry the news to the States, as they made a public discourse of the affair. Complains of Corney as an “ unsufferable, scandalous, lying, prating fellow;” not being able to find out her business, he abuses and threatens to kill Scott, and writes to everybody in Holland that Scott visits her [the writer] boasting much of his own employment, and of letters that he receives from Lord Arlington, the Lord Chamberlain, &amp;c. He comes daily to see her talking at such a rate of his employments, the ladies at Court, &amp;c, that she has hardly patience to hear his rhodomontade. Begs for letters and money; is almost out of her wits at not hearing from him, and Mr. Scott thinks much of it. He is so fearful that he will not let his own handwriting go.</p>"
SP_29/173_f.3,Aphara Behn,Mr. Halsall,1666-09-25,-,London,"<p>A. B. [Aphara Behn] to Halsall. Has just heard from Holland that De Ruyter is sick, if not dead, of an imposthume, probably the plague; that Banckaert and many others are ill; that Blackgrave and Wogan are gone to Utrecht, where something may be hatched, but</p><br><p><cpg id=""cmpg1325"" first=""yes"">157</cpg><pg id=""cmpg1325"" seq=""0188"" first=""yes"">157</pg>for want of money [Scott] cannot go to them there; that John Lodge's servant has gone for England and may carry letters; he was with the quaker before he left, but he will not know anything, as he is neither a quaker nor a fanatic. The plague is very much in the [Dutch] fleet, which might he easily beaten.</p>"
SP_29/173_f.4,Aphara Behn,Mr. Halsall,1666-09-25,Rotterdam,Antwerp,"<p>Contents of a letter from [Scott to Aphara Behn]. De Ruyter has gone for Amsterdam, so ill that it is thought he will die. The French fleet has returned to Brest. The Dutch boast that the English are gone in, and durst not engage them. They scorn the letter that Kevit has sent, and have noted him a traitor. The fanatics conclude that, as the post has not come in, there are troubles in England, but they can do nothing till Col. Sydney's return, in 10 days. A watch should be kept on Mr. Cockaine, formerly Whitelock's chaplain; he corresponds with Lockier, the minister, now privately at Rotterdam. Cannot join Doleman and the fanatic English at Utrecht, for want of money.</p>"
SP_29/172_f.84,Scott,Aphara Behn,1666-09-30,-,Antwerp,"<p>Contents of a letter from [Scott] to Aphara [Behn]. It is said that the fire of London will compel the King to make peace and call home his fleet. The States think their letter to the King extremely civil, and full of arguments that cannot be answered except by compliance, or by a scheme which will render his juggling visible to his neighbours. De Ruyter is dead or dangerously ill, notwithstanding </p><br><p><cpg id=""cmpg1210"" first=""yes"">143</cpg><pg id=""cmpg1210"" seq=""0174"" first=""yes"">143</pg>the reports of his recovery. De Witt has gone to Zealand to the fleet, to restore order, though it is said to be to welcome Beaufort, for which purpose three deputies were to be sent, but only De Witt is gone. They pretend to have found out much by Buat, who is still close prisoner. Smith, a Scotch merchant, has been taken up on suspicion, and will probably be a close prisoner as well as Dr. Macdowell. Trump has been before the Council of State; he called his accusations lies, said he would do the same things if they were to be done over again, and they parted very angry.</p>"
SP_29/177_f.51,Aphra Behn,Henry Bennet Earl of Arlington,1666-11-03,Antwerp,London,"<p>Astrea [Aphara Behn to Lord Arlington]. Came over on his lordship's business. No person in the world but herself could have drawn him [Scott] to the service. Has written constantly, begging for encouragement for him and for supplies, but could get no answers. For want of money, [Scott] can neither get at his papers nor go to the Hague; has sent copies of his letters from the prison where he lies, and now dares not write to Scott, having fooled him so long. Is in debt and extreme want herself, and as encouragement for her service, is likely to lose all her things and be put into prison; has pawned her rings and all she had; begs not to be ruined and disgraced in a strange place; entreats help for a poor stranger, whose life or death is in his hands.</p>"
SP_29/182_f.168,Aphra Behn,Henry Bennet Earl of Arlington,1666-12-26,-,London,"<p>Aphara Behn to Lord Arlington. Knows the justness of her cause, or would be wild with her hard treatment; applies to him as her last hope, and the fountain of mercy; the delays have caused her twice the expense she would have had; would not beg nor starve, and had to get credit, &amp;. Desires much to come home if she had money, though confident that with the supplies promised, she could do much, as he [Scott] will have his liberty in a few days. Wants a bill for 100<i>l.,</i> of which her friend shall have part; cannot return without this; is a poor stranger and her life depends on it. Did not desire the place she has, nor the voyage; must come by this convoy, or will have to stay two months longer. Gives an extract from her friend's letter, in which he says that neither failure of money nor anything shall make him fail in his duty, and begs to see her once more before she returns, as he has many important things to tell her. Would have given all his letter, but many of hers have miscarried.</p>"
SP_29/211_f.34,Samuel Pepys,Sir Joseph Williamson,1667-07-27,Navy Office,Whitehall,"<p>S. Pepys to Williamson. The East India prize papers are in Sir John Mennes's hands, though Sir John does not know that Pepys knows this; Williamson must therefore take his own method to satisfy himself concerning them.</p>"
